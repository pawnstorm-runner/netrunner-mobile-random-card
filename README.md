# random-netrunner-card
Show me a random netrunner card

Adapted from http://pawnstorm.net/projects/netrunner-random-card.html, but in an attempt to include the entire cardlist in the HTML/Javascript rather than query it every time. In theory, this should make it faster. Also, try to create a workflow to automatically update that embedded list for whenever the card list changes (which should be infrequent, only a few times a year or less.)
